  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <p><a href = "https://techterms.com/definition/html" target = "_blank" title = "html definition">Stands for "Hypertext
  Markup Language." </a> HTML is the language used to create webpages.
  <strong>"Hypertext" <u>refers</u> to the hyperlinks that an HTML page may contain. "Markup language"</strong>
  refers to the way tags are used to define the page layout and elements within the page.
  <img src = "coding.jpg"  width = "100%">
  </p><p style = "margin-top:45px;">
  Below is an example of HTML used to define a basic webpage with
  a title and a single paragraph of text.</p>
  The web has gone through many changes over the past
  few decades, but HTML has always been the fundamental
  language used to develop webpages. Interestingly, while websites have become more advanced and interactive, HTML has actually gotten simpler. If you compare the source of an HTML5 page with a similar page written in HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0, the HTML5 page would probably contain less code. This is because modern HTML relies on cascading style sheets or JavaScript to format nearly all the elements within a page.
